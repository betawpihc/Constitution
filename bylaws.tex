\chapter{Offices}

The Corporation shall have and continuously maintain in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a Principal Office and a Resident Agent, and may have other offices within or without the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

\chapter{Board of Directors}

\section{General Powers}

All of the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed and controlled by the Board of Directors. The following are the matters which must be submitted to, and receive the approval of, the Board of Directors:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Annual financial statements.

\item The amendment or restatement of these bylaws or the articles of organization.

\item The merger, consolidation, or dissolution of the corporation.

\item The sale, lease, exchange, pledge, or mortgage of any substantial part of the assets of the Corporation, or any contract, option, or other agreement with respect thereto.

\item Such other matters as to which the Board of Directors determines by resolution that such submission is advisable.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Number, Election, and Tenure}

At the regular annual meeting, the existing Directors shall elect Directors for terms commencing on the first day of the next August and continuing for three years and until their respective successors are elected and take office. Persons who are Directors by virtue of election are referred to as `elected Directors' in these Bylaws. The number of elected Directors shall not be less than four or more than ten. In addition, unless already Directors by virtue of election, the President, the Treasurer, and the House Manager of the Eta Tau Chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity shall be ex officio Directors of the Corporation during the times such persons occupy their offices as President, Treasurer, and House Manager, respectively, of the Eta Tau Chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity. These three Directors are referred to as `ex officio Directors' in these Bylaws.

In order to be elected and in order to hold office, each elected Director must be a person who was conferred a Bachelor's Degree or Master's Degree by Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and at the time so conferred was an initiated Brother in good standing of the Eta Tau Chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.

In the event that the number of elected Directors falls to less than four, through resignations or any other cause, the Board of Directors shall take no action other than the election of Directors until the number of elected Directors is at least four.

\section{Staggered Terms}

The elected Directors shall be divided into three groups about equal in number with the Directors comprising each group having terms of office that expire in a different year than of Directors in the other groups, so that the terms of office of about one-third of elected Directors expire each year.

\section{Regular Meetings}

A regular annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held in August of each year, at such time and place as shall be designated by the President or Vice President in the notice of the meeting for the purpose of electing Directors and officers and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting. The Board of Directors may provide by resolution for the holding of additional regular meetings.

The Directors, all officers of the Corporation, and all persons who are alumni in good standing of the Eta Tau Chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity shall be permitted to attend any regular meeting of the Board of Directors. Other persons may be, but need not be, excluded.

\section{Special Meetings}

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by order of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President, and shall be held at such time and place as shall be designated by the Chairman or President in the notice of the meeting.

The Directors and all officers of the Corporation shall be permitted to attend any special meeting of the Board of Directors. Other persons may be, but need not be, excluded.

\section{Electronic Participation in Meetings}

The Board of Directors may permit any or all Directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which all Directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A Director participating in a meeting by this means is considered to be present in person at the meeting, and is said to be `participating electronically'.

\section{Notice of Meetings}

Notice of the time and place of any meeting of the Board of Directors shall be delivered personally, by mail, or by email, to each of the elected Directors; and shall be delivered to the ex officio Directors collectively by mail or email to such mailing address or email address as the Eta Tau Chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity shall designate for receiving such notice. Notice shall be delivered at least seven days prior if the Directors are permitted to participate electronically, and at least fourteen days prior if any Director is not permitted to participate electronically. A Director may waive notice. The attendance of a Director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting, except where a Director attends a meeting for the purpose of objecting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice of the meeting unless required by statute.

\section{Quorum}

Four Directors present in person shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, unless the number of Directors is less than four, in which case the quorum shall be three, and unless the presence of a greater number is required by law, in which case the quorum shall be such number as the law requires.

\section{Manner of Acting}

\subsection{Formal Action by Directors}

The act of a majority of Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.

\subsection{Informal Action by Directors}

No action of the Board of Directors shall be valid unless taken at a meeting at which a quorum is present, excepting any action taken without a meeting for which a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by each Director entitled to vote.

\section{Resignations and Removal}

Any elected Director may resign from the Board of Directors at any time by giving notice in writing to the President or Secretary of the Corporation, and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

Additionally, any elected Director who is absent from all meetings of the Board of Directors occurring in a thirteen month period entirely within his term of office, the number of meetings in the period for which notice was properly given being at least two, thereby resigns from the Board of Directors.

\section{Vacancies}

Any vacancy occurring in an elected Directorship may be filled by the Board of Directors for the unexpired portion of the term of office. Any Directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of Directors shall be filled by the Board of Directors.
